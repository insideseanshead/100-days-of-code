# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a Modal and form for adding racers and cars to gaslands app.

**Thoughts:** Started this app this last week. Wanted to build the front end for template with handlebars but concerned that I should have started with back end and that I may have to do a bit of refactoring and reverse engineing when I start trying to link my DB.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today's job was to begin to build the database structure for my app. The app will require several connected tables so spending the time to propperly build out my models is very important.

**Thoughts:** I am finding my ability to read code is improving. So much of the code in the Bootcamp was "boilerplate" so we never really learned how to write or edit a lot of basic functionallity. But going back I find I am able to read the code with some ease and change and add what I need to get things rolling... hopefully.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from my Gaslands app today to do some refreshing on mongodb and react. Going through the traversy media learn mern stack as it is something we only briefly touched on in the boot camp.

**Thoughts:** Taking the extra time to implement the different elements of react is nice. In the bootcamp things came at me so fast I felt I wasn't grasping a lot of the core concepts. Being able to pause and look at what I am doing, I find it is making a lot more sense. The tutorial is also a couple years old now so I have to do a bit of troubleshooting, with the console and react I am able to track down updated packages or find hiccups much easier than I could before.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: To continue on with yesterdays tutorial on Mern apps I worked on a redux tutorial for the afternoon. 

**Thoughts:** State still flumuxes me. I get the theory but in practice I still have a hard time understanding how to implement. I think I need to take a further step back in my review of React.

### Day 5: January 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with my Mern project I am following along with the tutorial and adding redux to the shopping list app. 

**Thoughts:** While a lot of this still goes over my head the repetition is helping a lot. I am starting to see how the different components are linking up and how state is utilized better.

### Day 6: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished shopping list app and attempting to upload full mern app to Heroku 

**Thoughts:** I say attempting because I keep hitting an error that I can't quite sus out. I'm going to give my eyes a rest and come back and look at the logs and see if I can find where I am missing something.

### Day 7: January 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started building my seed for my Gaslands app and tried to get my db running and models set up.

**Thoughts:** Kept running into errors with my models and the name of one of my models showing up as null. Took longer than I care to admit... and an extra set of eyes to realize I wasn't returning one of my models.

### Day 8: January 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finally got my Models working and my DB is up and running. Began seeding the tables with the info they will need as well as some temp data for rendering the final cards for my gaslands app. Then got Handlebars set up and functioning after a bit of funky happening with the routes. Now my site is being run off the server and is dynamically generating cards with info using Handlebars.

**Thoughts:** Today was a test in troubleshooting. Nothing was working how I thought it would. A good test of google fu helped me find npm packages that solved some rendering proplems as well as just playing around with my routes and dom to get the information I wanted to where it needed to be. In learning art we would talk about platues that sometimes you will create and be at a certain level for a while till you make that next connection in your head and then your skills take a big leap. I think today might be one of those leaps.

### Day 9: January 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today was more of a workhorse day than a eurika day. Helped a friend with their react site today. Simple scrolling error cause by the hide attribute in the css. Put in an hour on free code camp reviewing my css and working my way through their certificates. Tonights work on my app was spent adding models and seeding the base information my app will need to create stats for the different cars the user can create.

**Thoughts:** As I said a simple day. Lot's of troubleshooting and looking through code and errors reports tying to sus out where a typo is or where something isn't returned. Wanted to start tackeling implementing cloudinary but realized without the ability to create a new car card there wouldn't be a place to implement the image module. So the next few days will be spent flushing out handlebars a bit more and getting the site navigable. Being able to create select boxes filled with options based on my DB.
