# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a Modal and form for adding racers and cars to gaslands app.

**Thoughts:** Started this app this last week. Wanted to build the front end for template with handlebars but concerned that I should have started with back end and that I may have to do a bit of refactoring and reverse engineing when I start trying to link my DB.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today's job was to begin to build the database structure for my app. The app will require several connected tables so spending the time to propperly build out my models is very important.

**Thoughts:** I am finding my ability to read code is improving. So much of the code in the Bootcamp was "boilerplate" so we never really learned how to write or edit a lot of basic functionallity. But going back I find I am able to read the code with some ease and change and add what I need to get things rolling... hopefully.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from my Gaslands app today to do some refreshing on mongodb and react. Going through the traversy media learn mern stack as it is something we only briefly touched on in the boot camp.

**Thoughts:** Taking the extra time to implement the different elements of react is nice. In the bootcamp things came at me so fast I felt I wasn't grasping a lot of the core concepts. Being able to pause and look at what I am doing, I find it is making a lot more sense. The tutorial is also a couple years old now so I have to do a bit of troubleshooting, with the console and react I am able to track down updated packages or find hiccups much easier than I could before.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: To continue on with yesterdays tutorial on Mern apps I worked on a redux tutorial for the afternoon. 

**Thoughts:** State still flumuxes me. I get the theory but in practice I still have a hard time understanding how to implement. I think I need to take a further step back in my review of React.

### Day 5: January 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with my Mern project I am following along with the tutorial and adding redux to the shopping list app. 

**Thoughts:** While a lot of this still goes over my head the repetition is helping a lot. I am starting to see how the different components are linking up and how state is utilized better.

### Day 6: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished shopping list app and attempting to upload full mern app to Heroku 

**Thoughts:** I say attempting because I keep hitting an error that I can't quite sus out. I'm going to give my eyes a rest and come back and look at the logs and see if I can find where I am missing something.
