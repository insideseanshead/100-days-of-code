# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a Modal and form for adding racers and cars to gaslands app.

**Thoughts:** Started this app this last week. Wanted to build the front end for template with handlebars but concerned that I should have started with back end and that I may have to do a bit of refactoring and reverse engineing when I start trying to link my DB.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today's job was to begin to build the database structure for my app. The app will require several connected tables so spending the time to propperly build out my models is very important.

**Thoughts:** I am finding my ability to read code is improving. So much of the code in the Bootcamp was "boilerplate" so we never really learned how to write or edit a lot of basic functionallity. But going back I find I am able to read the code with some ease and change and add what I need to get things rolling... hopefully.
