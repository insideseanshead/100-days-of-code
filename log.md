# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Added a Modal and form for adding racers and cars to gaslands app.

**Thoughts:** Started this app this last week. Wanted to build the front end for template with handlebars but concerned that I should have started with back end and that I may have to do a bit of refactoring and reverse engineing when I start trying to link my DB.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today's job was to begin to build the database structure for my app. The app will require several connected tables so spending the time to propperly build out my models is very important.

**Thoughts:** I am finding my ability to read code is improving. So much of the code in the Bootcamp was "boilerplate" so we never really learned how to write or edit a lot of basic functionallity. But going back I find I am able to read the code with some ease and change and add what I need to get things rolling... hopefully.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from my Gaslands app today to do some refreshing on mongodb and react. Going through the traversy media learn mern stack as it is something we only briefly touched on in the boot camp.

**Thoughts:** Taking the extra time to implement the different elements of react is nice. In the bootcamp things came at me so fast I felt I wasn't grasping a lot of the core concepts. Being able to pause and look at what I am doing, I find it is making a lot more sense. The tutorial is also a couple years old now so I have to do a bit of troubleshooting, with the console and react I am able to track down updated packages or find hiccups much easier than I could before.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: To continue on with yesterdays tutorial on Mern apps I worked on a redux tutorial for the afternoon. 

**Thoughts:** State still flumuxes me. I get the theory but in practice I still have a hard time understanding how to implement. I think I need to take a further step back in my review of React.

### Day 5: January 5, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with my Mern project I am following along with the tutorial and adding redux to the shopping list app. 

**Thoughts:** While a lot of this still goes over my head the repetition is helping a lot. I am starting to see how the different components are linking up and how state is utilized better.

### Day 6: January 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished shopping list app and attempting to upload full mern app to Heroku 

**Thoughts:** I say attempting because I keep hitting an error that I can't quite sus out. I'm going to give my eyes a rest and come back and look at the logs and see if I can find where I am missing something.

### Day 7: January 8, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started building my seed for my Gaslands app and tried to get my db running and models set up.

**Thoughts:** Kept running into errors with my models and the name of one of my models showing up as null. Took longer than I care to admit... and an extra set of eyes to realize I wasn't returning one of my models.

### Day 8: January 9, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finally got my Models working and my DB is up and running. Began seeding the tables with the info they will need as well as some temp data for rendering the final cards for my gaslands app. Then got Handlebars set up and functioning after a bit of funky happening with the routes. Now my site is being run off the server and is dynamically generating cards with info using Handlebars.

**Thoughts:** Today was a test in troubleshooting. Nothing was working how I thought it would. A good test of google fu helped me find npm packages that solved some rendering proplems as well as just playing around with my routes and dom to get the information I wanted to where it needed to be. In learning art we would talk about platues that sometimes you will create and be at a certain level for a while till you make that next connection in your head and then your skills take a big leap. I think today might be one of those leaps.

### Day 9: January 11, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today was more of a workhorse day than a eurika day. Helped a friend with their react site today. Simple scrolling error cause by the hide attribute in the css. Put in an hour on free code camp reviewing my css and working my way through their certificates. Tonights work on my app was spent adding models and seeding the base information my app will need to create stats for the different cars the user can create.

**Thoughts:** As I said a simple day. Lot's of troubleshooting and looking through code and errors reports tying to sus out where a typo is or where something isn't returned. Wanted to start tackeling implementing cloudinary but realized without the ability to create a new car card there wouldn't be a place to implement the image module. So the next few days will be spent flushing out handlebars a bit more and getting the site navigable. Being able to create select boxes filled with options based on my DB.

### Day 10: January 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Unfortunately got side tracked with a bit of freelance work last week. life of an illustrator. Part of why I am trying to pivot careers to web design. Today I did a review crash course on React and have been inspired to finish my react illustration portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Still trying to crack the code to dynamically making thumbnails. The ideal outcome is to have a portfolio site that I can simply add an image link and alt text to a DB and it dynamically adds it into the gallery. So I can easily add new work as I finish it. Making sure my portfolio is always up to date.

### Day 11: January 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on using flexbox to arrange my image galler dynamically, along with some css tricks to animate and enlarge the image that is being hovered over. Found out bulma does not have a built in sicky navbar component so spent an hour researching ways to implement that in react. Have a version working though it is set ot offsety which at varying screen sizes seems to be an issue. Must research more. Following up on that I used bulma colums to set up and design my contact component.

**Thoughts:** I think back to art school and using the right tools for the job. Bulma is missing some key components that I would find in a more robust cssframework like bootstrap means I probably won't use it to much in the future. Definetly more comfortable with React after yesterdays review. Look forward to implementing a backend to store my image assets and building a dev side where I can simply upload new assets to my gallery without needing to make ftp uploads.

### Day 12: January 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Getting to the final stretch of my portfolio project. Added lightbox feature with react as well as made all my images into global state. Also created an image component so all images in my portfolio are individual components. Next up is adding the back end and making those calls from a DB rather than state. 

**Thoughts:** It's getting easier to understand what it is I am doing and I can see how things are working better. Even if I am building off the structure of tutorials I am able to change things and addapt as necessary. I am excited to figure out the back end and eventually a basic crud system for adding new images and removing old.

### Day 13: January 22, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Today I wanted to get cloudinary up and running. But because A friend asked to see what I have been working on I decided to launch my in process portfolio to Heroku. After a lot of googling and help from a friend we got it up and running but then my images wern't working properly because they were not https and heroku wouldn't load them because of that for reasons. So long story short Cloudinary is the next thing to get added so I can have my images come from a cloudinary data base.

**Thoughts:** Two steps forward one step back. Today was practice in dealing with frustration and troubleshooting. At the end of the day I was able to launch my site but it kept me from working what I was really hoping to get done today.

### Day 14: January 23, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Spent something like 6 hours to be able to make an spi call from cloudinary. Did a Breaking bad api app tutorial to help me review and work through. Ultimately if it wern't for the help of my friend Kayla who struggled with this herself I wouldn't have figured out where to find the very not well signposted settings in Cloudinary to make it work. So finally getting the call but now having an async issue with getting the call to come through and then updating the state. So my images state array most times doesn't get the info which breaks my gallery component and I am tired and will spend tomorrow reviewing asyncrinous functions.

**Thoughts:** Frustrated. If I could only get this api call to work then the basic functionallity of my site would be complete. I am going to look into other ways of uploading images to a website that isn't cloudinary.

### Day 15: January 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Simple no frills day of just trying to dry out some old code and utilize some of the react elements I have been learning making my illustration portfolio site.
**Thoughts:** Stressful day of trying to get in the habbit of applying for jobs so I took it a bit easy on the code. Want to make my dev site a bit cleaner so working on that. Debating the merrits of trying to fix something within an existing frame work or just building from the ground up with what I know now.
